        <h1> NATURE </h1>
        <p>   Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the
              physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.
              Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other
              natural phenomena.</p>
